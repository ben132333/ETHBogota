                            Transparency has always been lacking in the world at large, in almost every industry, but especially the music industry. That’s why we are huge proponents of the power of Web3 and many of the features of it like blockchain, and the ability it has to bring transparency to the world. The potential of Web3 has incredible implications on what the future of the world will look like. Some of its opportunities are potentially beyond our comprehension at the point in time as the space develops, but one area it will have a resounding and positive effect on immediately is the power of ownership. Web2, while an amazing advancement in technology, left the vast amount of people creating a majority of the content without any actual ownership. We are excited about the
                            potential of the space to put the power back in the hands of the creators and in turn creating a flourishing world of community. We have invested in many Web3 companies including DeMuse, Moonpay, Portals, Magic Eden, Axie Infinity, Mythical games, Superplastic, Metaplex, Sling Shot, Alchemy and RTFKT just to name a few.
                          </h3>
                          <h3 id="3781" class="blog-subtitle">One exciting development in the Web3 space is the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (or “NFTs”), which are implemented on a blockchain. NFTs can link to, record ownership of, or otherwise be associated with certain content, data or rights. For example, NFTs can be associated with a specific piece of digital art, music, or memorabilia and even concert tickets. We believe music NFTs specifically can provide an incredible opportunity for artists to connect with their fans and create a community in a transparent manner.</h3>
                          <h3 id="5d55" class="blog-subtitle">
                            For the last 10 years we have toured the world, made 2 EPs and 4 albums, and followed our fans wherever you’ve been — to every continent, country, arena, festival, and social media platform. We’ve been chasing you because you are the reason we do this. We’ve had ups and downs and made mistakes, but you have always been there for us. For the last 2 years we obsessed over this album. We thought about you a lot and we thought about how we couldn’t have gotten here without you. This album is for every one of you that supported us, that came to a show, that streamed a song, that liked a post, that hugged us when you saw us. We knew these next few years for us were about going deeper and not wider. Forging real meaningful bonds with our biggest supporters via any
                            avenue we could, from Discord to Fanhouse. That said, we didn’t want to stop there. We thought long and hard about how to make this community official and how to give back to our fans.
                          </h3>

                          <h3 id="e958" class="blog-subtitle">We are working with DeMuse to make (or “mint”) 5,000 NFTs, which are referred to as Limited Digital Assets or LDAs on DeMuse’s platform — they are tokens that have music rights and additional benefits embedded in them. The tokens will include, among other perks, a right to a proportional collective of a 1% audio streaming royalty from all 13 songs on our finished album.</h3>

                          <h3 id="7991" class="blog-subtitle">A number of artists have done this in the past, but not for free. It was important for us to do it this way because this isn’t about profiting off some new tech for us, it’s about connecting more deeply with you and harnessing a new disruptive technology in an effective way that truly shows what is possible as we head towards a Web3 world.</h3>
                          <h3 id="ba50" class="blog-subtitle">As a holder of one of these tokens, you will also be able to join a private Discord sub-channel with access to exclusive content, info, and us directly.</h3>
                          <h3 id="d67b" class="blog-subtitle">We are also planning giveaways and surprises and priority access to tickets, merch, and events to support our community. The first giveaway will be VIP tickets and meet &amp; greet to an upcoming headline show. Owning multiple tokens may also give you access to additional perks and opportunities that we will announce randomly. Think of this NFT as a direct channel to you all where we can airdrop you directly all sorts of things over time!</h3>
                          <h3 id="1297" class="blog-subtitle">Of course, as with most NFT products, after the initial drop, you will be able to transfer and sell your token if you choose. Typically NFT creators get a percentage of secondary sales which is paid back to them so they can continue to earn money on their art every time it’s resold. That is part of the beauty of NFTs and how it can help artists make a living in perpetuity.</h3>

Instead, the 7.5% fee of every secondary sale will get distributed equally amongst 14 songwriters who wrote the album songs with us.</span><span> Because of antiquated laws and old judgments, we believe songwriters are underpaid. We couldn’t have written these songs without this core group of amazing writers and we wanted to find a way to give them something extra for being a part of our journey. They are: Emily Warren, Ian Kirkpatrick, Whethan, JKash, Aldae, Madi Yarnovsky, Chloe George, Natalie Salomon, Fatman Scoop, Nick Long, Jeff Halavacs, Alex Schwartz, Joe Khajadourian, and Adam Melchor.</span></span></span

There’ve been times where we were nervous about doing something like this as well, but we thought if we presented it with the best intentions and removed any sort of financial gain then you might see it as a pure gesture to our community. Also, in working closely with DeMuse the past 8 months we knew we could deliver an amazing drop that exceeded any expectations… This is just the beginning!</h3>

While they are tied to a royalty from our album So Far So Good, there is no guarantee that you will receive a specific amount of royalties from the drop. It is also important to note that if you acquire one of the NFTs in the giveaway, you own the actual token, but not the intellectual property rights in the content, recordings, music, audio, materials, and/or images linked to or associated with the NFT, although for as long you own such token you are granted a license to use and display the content, materials, and/or images linked to or associated with your NFT for your personal, non-commercial use. In all cases, it is very important to review in full the
                                  terms of service (both DeMuse’s standard terms and the specific artist terms for the drop) as well as the NFT agreement that you will be required to sign before claiming your NFT.</span

The potential of Web3 has incredible implications on what the future of the world will look like. Some of its opportunities are potentially beyond our comprehension at the point in time as the space develops, but one area it will have a resounding and positive effect on immediately is the power of ownership. Web2, while an amazing advancement in technology, left the vast amount of people creating a majority of the content without any actual ownership. We are excited about the potential of the space to put the power back in the hands of the creators and in turn creating a flourishing world of community.
