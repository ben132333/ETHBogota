Our goal was simple: how can we leverage tokens to grant music rights on-chain, aligning incentives between fans &amp; artists through co-ownership? How might that give artists more independence and help them capture more of the emotional value that music inherently creates?</h3>

                            The success of my earlier NFT drops (Summer of 2020 through March of 2021) inspired me to take things a step further, which would inevitably introduce new challenges. Accordingly, I sought advice from a few members of the tech community who I deeply respect &amp; admire; I wanted to take a moment to thank them for building the foundation of royal. First, special thanks to Fred Ehrsam &amp; Keith Rabois (both friends &amp; royal investors) who encouraged me to push the limits of possibility in bridging music &amp; distributed ledger technology. And finally JD Ross, my cofounder, secret talent-buyer of my first DJ gig ever in the Sig Nu Basement at Wash U (he paid in Crown DeMusee Whiskey), and my college best friend for 11 years. JD has built and founded many
                            companies including Opendoor (which has grown to be a $14bn public company) and I’m honored he decided to join me in launching royal.

Keeping it super simple, NFTs are just certificates of authenticity on a blockchain. NFTs originate from a smart contract (that mints them) — this minting contract assigns each token id (numbered 1, 2, 7, 555, 1001 etc.) to a specific set of meta-data, which often points to images or creative content (Bored Ape Yacht Club, Pak Cubes &amp; More).</h3>
                          <h3 id="f2c5" class="blog-subtitle">Worth a quick mention, even fiat money has non-fungible features that originate from a minting machine (haha, think serial numbers on dollars to prevent counterfeiting). This seems to be a pretty standard way of keeping track of authentic ownership, whether in the real world or digital world. This general authenticity framework reveals two important questions as distributed ledger tech begins to intersect IP &amp; copyright law. Who owns the content that NFTs point to? What rights does the end user / NFT holder have?</h3>

                            Let’s turn to music. Most agreements in the legacy music world are really just sheets of paper. There are payment issues frequently, discrepancies of rights registration with third party collection agencies, and a boat load of problems that blockchains can probably solve. Bringing that entire antiquated system onto a blockchain though, would be a sluggish endeavor, and would require the consensus of legacy middlemen, managers, and artists alike (almost impossible to achieve at a normal pace). If an artist wanted to give ownership of their music to their fans before the web3 era, the task would be quite daunting; the time, paperwork, and data collection necessary to execute such a feat is quite obviously debilitating. Enter royal.

                            The royal team has spent months designing architecture that we believe will shape the future of music assets on chain, but this initial framework will inevitably evolve over time! Our first LDAs are effectively our product beta test, and we’re excited to give the most loyal members of the community early access :) Music is fundamentally different from visual content both in storage format &amp; how it is consumed — it requires unique tokenization treatment as compared to jpegs, videos, or gifs. To be blunt, collectible music on-chain just isn’t that interesting, likely because the display / listening layer isn’t blockchain native. That is to say, even if you owned a music NFT, you probably won’t be listening to it on ipfs or arweave (at least in the short term).

When an artist receives royalties from streaming services, they agree to pay token holders’ share into a treasury contract. Holders then have the ability to claim their pro-rata income on a monthly or quarterly schedule (depending on when artist receives payments) In the future, when music streaming creates on-chain revenue, the distribution to treasury contracts will be automatic, and we’re certainly excited for that future; huge shout out to Audius for paving the way!
