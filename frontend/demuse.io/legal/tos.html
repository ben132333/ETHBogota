                        Welcome to <a href="../index.html">https://royal.io</a>. Please read these Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at https://royal.io (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), the platform on which users of such platform (herein referred to as a “<strong>User</strong>” or collectively, “<strong>Users</strong>”, “<strong>you</strong>” or words of similar meaning) may post or purchase nonfungible tokens (the “<strong>DeMuse Platform</strong>”) and decentralized artist support platform accessible via the Site, and if applicable, the corresponding mobile applications, if any, (“<strong>App</strong>”) offered by DeMuse Markets Inc., a Delaware corporation (“<strong>DeMuse</strong>”, “our” or words of similar
                        meaning) (you and DeMuse shall each be a “<strong>Party</strong>” hereto and collectively the “<strong>Parties</strong>”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services, and App are collectively called the “<strong>Services</strong>.” By continuing to browse, access and use our Services, you acknowledge and accept the terms and conditions set out below. If you do not accept, you must cease access to and use our services immediately. You understand that, as a part of the Services, DeMuse may require that you read, acknowledge, and accept additional terms or documents (including, but not limited to, the Artist Terms (as such term is defined below) and all related documents), and by doing so, you shall make yourself a party to such documents and agree to
                        be bound by the terms contained therein.
                      </p>
                      <p>If you choose to accept these Terms, you must do so as it is presented to you – no changes will be accepted by us. If any future changes are unacceptable to you, you should discontinue using the Services. Your continued use of the Services now, or following the posting of any such changes, will indicate your acceptance of these Terms, and of any such changes.</p>
                      <p><strong>WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ROYAL THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 21 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION) BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 21 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 20 (GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM CHOICE) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.</strong></p>
                      <p><strong>SONG TOKENS PURCHASED ON THE ROYAL PLATFORM ARE NON-RETURNABLE.</strong></p>
                      <p>DeMuse is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or creditor. DeMuse provides a peer-to-peer web service that helps Users discover and interact with each other and Song Tokens available in public blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the Song Tokens or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of Song Tokens.  To use our Services, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.</p>
                      <p>DeMuse is not a party to any agreement between any Users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of any User or Song Token (and any content associated with such Song Token) visible on the Service.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services under such applicable law.</li>

If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes.

                                    A. Payment Information. You may purchase a Song Token using a credit card or debit card, as required. You expressly authorize us (and any payment processor) to charge your payment card for all purchases you make. For credit card payments, we charge your credit card when your purchase a Song Token. The bank issuing your credit or card may control when to release funds in the case of an order cancellation or refund. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your transaction, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “<strong>Payment Information</strong>”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all
                                    payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). We reserve the right to use the Payment Information you provide us in connection with any payments to provide better service to you should you wish to use our service again in the future and to protect us from fraud and other losses. Completion of a payment transaction is contingent upon:
                                  </p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>you providing complete personal, account, transaction and any other information needed,</li>
                                    <li>authorization of the payment by your credit or debit card company, and</li>
                                    <li>acceptance of your payment.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>
                                    B. Payment and Refund Processing. Payments and refunds facilitated by the Services may be processed by a third-party payment processor (“<strong>Payment Processor</strong>”). You may be required to create an account with such Payment Processor, and by doing so, you are agreeing to comply with the Payment Processor’s terms of service. You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity, business and tax information and your bank information when you register with the Payment Processor. If, and to the extent, we accept, hold or transmit funds in connection with your purchase, you agree that we do so, on your behalf, as your limited agent and you hereby appoint DeMuse as your limited agent solely for the purpose of accepting payments
                                    from, and refunding payments to, Service Recipients on your behalf. In accepting appointment as your limited agent, we assume no liability for any of your acts or omissions.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    C. Chargebacks and Payment Holdback. We reserve the right to offset future payments, including any streaming royalties, to you (“<strong>Payment Holdbacks</strong>”) in certain cases including without limitation: (i) where your DeMuse Account is subject to excessive chargebacks resulting in additional costs or fees from the Payment Processor; (ii) where the Payment Processor withholds a percentage of a payment as a reserve, for example, as a result of actual or suspected fraudulent activity; or (iii) in certain cases where we decide, in our sole discretion, that it is prudent or necessary to reverse a transaction. We further reserve the right to implement Payment Holdbacks to you if payments are deemed suspicious or fraudulent, at our sole discretion. We
                                    will notify you that you are subject to a Payment Holdback and we may require that you provide supporting documentation or information related to the relevant payment(s) and corresponding purchase(s). If you do not provide such supporting evidence within the requested timeframe, we reserve the right to refund the payment and transfer any available funds from your wallet to your identified bank account or otherwise take any action we feel is reasonably necessary to comply with our compliance standards, including those imposed by any relevant financial institution, our Payment Processor, or the credit card network rules, as well as any applicable law.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    D. Failure to Process Payments, Refunds or Chargebacks. You are solely responsible for the information you provide in connection with payments and refunds processed via the Services. If you purchase a Song Token using a credit card, you are responsible for ensuring the bank issuing your credit card releases the funds. You remain solely liable for the price of the Song Token if you cancel or otherwise dispute the credit card transaction after purchasing the Song Token. We will not be liable for failure to complete any payment or refund from or to your DeMuse Account if you provide inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the payment or refund or for any fraudulent behavior conducted by you on the DeMuse Platform. Subject to applicable law, we
                                    reserve the right to send any delinquent, past due, or any other DeMuse Account that is in default to collections agencies to recover such past due amount.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>E. Purchasers are entirely responsible for the validity of their purchases. DeMuse is in no way responsible or liable for any fraud or misrepresentation on behalf of the Artist. DeMuse expressly disclaims any liability for the actions, including fraud, on the part of the third-party sellers on the DeMuse Platform. We have no insight or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct.</p>

                                  <strong>Restrictions on Song Token Transfers</strong>. If you elect to sell, purchase, or trade any Song Tokens, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the blockchain network governing such Song Token and you will be required to make or receive payments exclusively through the cryptocurrency wallet you have connected to your account. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. Accordingly, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Service. The sole exception to this restriction on reversing transactions is if you elect
                                  to sell, purchase, or trade any Song Tokens using credit card payments (as described above).

Gas fees fund the network of computers that run decentralized blockchain networks, meaning that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via a blockchain network.</li>

                                dispute.

                          <ol>
                            <li>The prices and liquidity of cryptocurrency assets (including Song Tokens) are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect Song Tokens made available through the Service, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Song Tokens will not lose money. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.</li>
                            <li>Our Service does not store, send, or receive cryptocurrency assets. This is because cryptocurrency assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of cryptocurrency assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on the Service. Transactions in Song Tokens may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in Song Tokens shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction.</li>
                            <li>There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that DeMuse will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service for transactions, however caused.</li>
                            <li>A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of a certain Song Token.</li>
                            <li>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of Song Tokens.</li>
                            <li>The Service may rely on third-party platforms to perform transactions with respect to any cryptocurrency assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.</li>
                            <li>There are risks associated with purchasing User generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. DeMuse reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on DeMuse. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on DeMuse serve as grounds for a claim against DeMuse.</li>
                            <li>We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and DeMuse has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.</li>
                            <li>The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.</li>
                            <li>There are risks associated with streaming royalties. Streaming royalties are dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to the popularity of a particular song and the song’s availability on streaming platforms. DeMusety payments are contingent upon third-parties, including service providers and distributors outside of DeMuse’s control. You accept and acknowledge that you may receive little or no streaming royalty payments in connection with a Song Token. DeMuse is not responsible for streaming royalty payments and does not represent or guarantee that you will receive any particular amount of streaming royalties.</li>
                            <li>DeMuse reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on the Services. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on the DeMuse Platform and/or inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against DeMuse.</li>

You agree to promptly notify DeMuse of any Claims and cooperate with the DeMuse Parties in defending such Claims. You further agree that the DeMuse Parties shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims, unless otherwise mutually agreed to, which may be at your cost and expense. DeMuse will have the right to demand and be paid its actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses on an ongoing basis without prejudice to any other remedies available to DeMuse. In any event, you
                          will not settle any Claim without DeMuse ’s prior written consent and you acknowledge and agree that any settlement or attempted settlement of the third-party Claims as described herein without DeMuse’s prior written consent shall be void. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ROYAL.

                        <li><strong>Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 19 “<strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you DeMuse are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in Delaware, and you and DeMuse each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</li>

                          <strong>Dispute Resolution.</strong>
                          <ol>
                            <li><strong>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</strong>. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be resolved <strong>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</strong>. You and DeMuse agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and DeMuse are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>. As limited exceptions to Section 19(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</strong>. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules. JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration at https://www.jamsadr.com/. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location, but will be conducted remotely to the extent permitted by the JAMS Rules. The parties agree that
                              the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Arbitration Costs</strong>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).</li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</strong>. Except as provided in Section 19(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
                              that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>. <strong>YOU AND ROYAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</li>
                            <li><strong>Severability</strong>. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 19(f) of these Terms (“<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</li>

You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.</li>

                              <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between DeMuse and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between DeMuse and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without DeMuse’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
                              DeMuse may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Notices</strong>. Any notices or other communications provided by DeMuse under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</li>
                            <li><strong>Waiver of Rights</strong>. DeMuse’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of DeMuse. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</li>

                  "content": "**Last Updated: August 8, 2022**\n\nWelcome to [https://royal.io](https://royal.io/). Please read these Terms of Service (the “**Terms**”) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at https://royal.io (the “**Site**”), the platform on which users of such platform (herein referred to as a “**User**” or collectively, “**Users**”, “**you**” or words of similar meaning) may post or purchase nonfungible tokens (the “**DeMuse Platform**”) and decentralized artist support platform accessible via the Site, and if applicable, the corresponding mobile applications, if any, (“**App**”) offered by DeMuse Markets Inc., a Delaware corporation (“**DeMuse**”, “our” or words of similar meaning) (you and DeMuse shall each be a “**Party**” hereto and collectively the “**Parties**”). To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our services, and App are collectively called the “**Services**.” By continuing to browse, access and use our Services, you acknowledge and accept the terms and conditions set out below. If you do not accept, you must cease access to and use our services immediately. You understand that, as a part of the Services, DeMuse may require that you read, acknowledge, and accept additional terms or documents (including, but not limited to, the Artist Terms (as such term is defined below) and all related documents), and by doing so, you shall make yourself a party to such documents and agree to be bound by the terms contained therein.\n\nIf you choose to accept these Terms, you must do so as it is presented to you – no changes will be accepted by us. If any future changes are unacceptable to you, you should discontinue using the Services. Your continued use of the Services now, or following the posting of any such changes, will indicate your acceptance of these Terms, and of any such changes.\n\n**WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ROYAL THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 21 (DISPUTE RESOLUTION) BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 21 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 20 (GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM CHOICE) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.**\n\n**SONG TOKENS PURCHASED ON THE ROYAL PLATFORM ARE NON-RETURNABLE.**\n\nDeMuse is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or creditor. DeMuse provides a peer-to-peer web service that helps Users discover and interact with each other and Song Tokens available in public blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the Song Tokens or blockchains you are interacting with and we do not execute or effectuate purchases, transfers, or sales of Song Tokens.  To use our Services, you must use a third-party wallet which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains.\n\nDeMuse is not a party to any agreement between any Users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of any User or Song Token (and any content associated with such Song Token) visible on the Service.\n\n1. **Agreement to Terms.** By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services under such applicable law.\n2. **Additional Terms and Policies.** Your use of the Services is subject to additional terms and policies as may be posted on the Services from time to time and that will include the following:\n    1. **Privacy Policy.** Please review our Privacy Policy linked [here](https://royal.io/legal/privacy), which also governs your use of the Services, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.\n    2. **Certain Risks**. Please review our Risks Associated with Song Tokens Acquired on the DeMuse Platform, linked [here](https://royal.io/legal/risks), for information on risks associated with transacting with Song Tokens on the DeMuse Platform.\n    3. **Artist Terms and Purchaser Terms**. If you are an Artist or a Purchaser (as each is defined below), you will be subject to the Artist Terms (as defined below) or Purchaser Terms (as defined below), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Artists and Purchasers are both considered Users as defined herein, and therefore all of the Terms contained herein apply to both Artists and Purchasers unless otherwise indicated herein or in the Artist Terms.\n    4. **DeMuse Programs**. Your participation in certain DeMuse programs (e.g., promotions, contests, etc.) will be subject to additional terms and conditions specific to such programs.\n    5. **Third-Party Service Providers**. We partner with certain third parties to assist with payments and legal compliance. By using our Services, you agree to the Wyre Payments, Inc. [User Agreement](https://www.sendwyre.com/user-agreement/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.sendwyre.com/privacy-policy/).\n3. **Changes to these Terms or the Services.** We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or through other means of communication. It is important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.\n4. **Who May Use the Services?** The Services are only available to Users in certain jurisdictions who can use the Services as permitted under applicable law. The Services are not authorized for use in certain other jurisdictions that are subject to a U.S. Government embargo, designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country, listed by the U.S. Government as a prohibited or restricted party, or otherwise have U.S. Government economic sanctions applied. Without limitation, you must be at least 18 years of age to use the Services. You may not attempt to access or use the Services if you are not permitted to do so.\n    1. **Account Creation**. For certain features of the Services, you’ll need an account. To register an account, you must first successfully complete the sign-up process. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and current account information and keep this information up to date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your account.\n        \n        To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account and password. YOU ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL ACTIVITIES AND CONDUCT, WHETHER BY YOU OR ANYONE ELSE, THAT ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. You may be held liable for any losses incurred by us or another party due to someone else using your account or password.\n        \n        You are only allowed to create one account and you agree you won’t share your account with anyone. You also agree that you will not: (i) create another account if we’ve disabled one you previously established, unless you have our prior written consent; (ii) buy, sell, rent or lease access to your account or username, unless you have our prior written consent; (iii) share your account password with anyone; or (iv) log in or try to log in to access the Service through unauthorized third party applications or clients.\n        \n    2. **Additional Information.** DeMuse may require you to provide additional information and documents at the request of any competent authority or in case of application of any applicable law or regulation, including laws related to anti-laundering (legalization) of incomes obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism.\n        \n        DeMuse may also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases where it has reasons to believe that: (i) your account is being used for money laundering or for any other illegal or unauthorized activity; (ii) you have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or (iii) transactions effected via your account were effected in breach of these Terms. In each such case, DeMuse, in its sole discretion, may disable (or terminate) your account until such additional information and documents are reviewed by DeMuse and are accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law.\n        \n        If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, DeMuse may refuse to provide the Services to you. We reserve the right to report any activity occurring using the Services to relevant tax authorities as required under applicable law. You are solely responsible for maintaining all relevant Tax (as defined below) records and complying with any reporting requirements you may have as related to our Services. You are further solely responsible for independently maintaining the accuracy of any record submitted to any tax authority including any information derived from the Services.\n        \n    3. **Right to Block Access.** We reserve the right, at any time, in our sole discretion, to block access to the Services from certain IP addresses and unique device identifiers.\n    4. **Equipment and Software.** You must provide all equipment, connectivity, and software necessary to connect to the Service. You are solely responsible for any fees, including Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing the Service.\n5. **About the Services.**\n    1. **Parties**. Our Services also allow music professionals (“**Artists**”) to sell certain non-fungible tokens (each, an “**Song Token**”) to third party entities or persons (“**Purchasers**”) via the DeMuse Platform. DeMuse is not a party to any transaction between Artists and any Purchaser. DeMuse does not control or vet content provided by Artists, nor does DeMuse assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information provided by Artists.\n    2. **Our Role**. You acknowledge and agree that the Song Token and any associated royalty payments, if any, shall be programmed to enable you to take certain actions to claim royalty payments and/or be self-executing via a governing blockchain’s (e.g., Polygon, Ethereum, and Solana) smart contract system and/or nonfungible token standard and DeMuse has no control or ability to modify such royalty payments, nor an obligation to collect or distribute such royalties to Artists or Purchasers.\n    3. **Our Relationship.** ROYAL IS A PLATFORM. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OR CREDITOR. THE SERVICE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLATFORM ONLY. ROYAL FACILITATES TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN A ARTIST AND PURCHASER BUT IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ARTIST AND PURCHASERS OF SONG TOKENS OR BETWEEN ANY PURCHASERS.\n    4. **Term of Relationship**\n        1. These Terms will apply to Users for as long as they continue to use the Site in compliance with these Terms and any additional terms that apply to their use of the DeMuse Platform (the “**Term**”).\n    5. **Artist Terms.**\n        1. By creating an account and minting a Song Token, you will be subject to  additional terms as set forth in the Artist Terms and Conditions (collectively, the “**Artist Terms**”).\n    6. **Purchaser Terms**.\n        1. **Song Token Fee**. Each Artist may require a fee to purchase one of its Song Tokens (“**Song Token Fee**”). As a Purchaser, you are responsible for paying the Song Token Fee directly to the Artist pursuant to any additional terms provided by such Artist in the Purchase Terms (defined below).\n        2. **Digital Rewards.** You may receive Song Tokens or other digital rewards in connection with your use of the Services. In order to receive digital rewards, you must first connect a third-party digital wallet or sign up for a custodial solution provided by DeMuse. Such digital rewards may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which you will be deemed to accept upon your receipt of such digital rewards.\n        3. **Credit Card Transactions**.\n            \n            A. Payment Information. You may purchase a Song Token using a credit card or debit card, as required. You expressly authorize us (and any payment processor) to charge your payment card for all purchases you make. For credit card payments, we charge your credit card when your purchase a Song Token. The bank issuing your credit or card may control when to release funds in the case of an order cancellation or refund. We may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your transaction, including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card and your email and postal addresses for billing and notification (such information, “**Payment Information**”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information). We reserve the right to use the Payment Information you provide us in connection with any payments to provide better service to you should you wish to use our service again in the future and to protect us from fraud and other losses. Completion of a payment transaction is contingent upon:\n            \n            - you providing complete personal, account, transaction and any other information needed,\n            - authorization of the payment by your credit or debit card company, and\n            - acceptance of your payment.\n            \n            B. Payment and Refund Processing. Payments and refunds facilitated by the Services may be processed by a third-party payment processor (“**Payment Processor**”). You may be required to create an account with such Payment Processor, and by doing so, you are agreeing to comply with the Payment Processor’s terms of service. You may need to provide additional information to verify your identity, business and tax information and your bank information when you register with the Payment Processor. If, and to the extent, we accept, hold or transmit funds in connection with your purchase, you agree that we do so, on your behalf, as your limited agent and you hereby appoint DeMuse as your limited agent solely for the purpose of accepting payments from, and refunding payments to, Service Recipients on your behalf. In accepting appointment as your limited agent, we assume no liability for any of your acts or omissions.\n            \n            C. Chargebacks and Payment Holdback. We reserve the right to offset future payments, including any streaming royalties, to you (“**Payment Holdbacks**”) in certain cases including without limitation: (i) where your DeMuse Account is subject to excessive chargebacks resulting in additional costs or fees from the Payment Processor; (ii) where the Payment Processor withholds a percentage of a payment as a reserve, for example, as a result of actual or suspected fraudulent activity; or (iii) in certain cases where we decide, in our sole discretion, that it is prudent or necessary to reverse a transaction. We further reserve the right to implement Payment Holdbacks to you if payments are deemed suspicious or fraudulent, at our sole discretion. We will notify you that you are subject to a Payment Holdback and we may require that you provide supporting documentation or information related to the relevant payment(s) and corresponding purchase(s). If you do not provide such supporting evidence within the requested timeframe, we reserve the right to refund the payment and transfer any available funds from your wallet to your identified bank account or otherwise take any action we feel is reasonably necessary to comply with our compliance standards, including those imposed by any relevant financial institution, our Payment Processor, or the credit card network rules, as well as any applicable law.\n            \n            D. Failure to Process Payments, Refunds or Chargebacks. You are solely responsible for the information you provide in connection with payments and refunds processed via the Services. If you purchase a Song Token using a credit card, you are responsible for ensuring the bank issuing your credit card releases the funds. You remain solely liable for the price of the Song Token if you cancel or otherwise dispute the credit card transaction after purchasing the Song Token. We will not be liable for failure to complete any payment or refund from or to your DeMuse Account if you provide inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the payment or refund or for any fraudulent behavior conducted by you on the DeMuse Platform. Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to send any delinquent, past due, or any other DeMuse Account that is in default to collections agencies to recover such past due amount.\n            \n            E. Purchasers are entirely responsible for the validity of their purchases. DeMuse is in no way responsible or liable for any fraud or misrepresentation on behalf of the Artist. DeMuse expressly disclaims any liability for the actions, including fraud, on the part of the third-party sellers on the DeMuse Platform. We have no insight or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct.\n            \n    7. **Costs and Taxes**. You are solely responsible for all costs incurred by you in using the Services and determining, collecting, reporting and paying all applicable Taxes. As used herein, “**Taxes**” means the taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges that you may be required by law to collect and remit to governmental agencies, and other similar municipal, state, federal and national indirect or other withholding and personal or corporate income taxes.\n        1. **Restrictions on Song Token Transfers**. If you elect to sell, purchase, or trade any Song Tokens, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the blockchain network governing such Song Token and you will be required to make or receive payments exclusively through the cryptocurrency wallet you have connected to your account. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. Accordingly, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Service. The sole exception to this restriction on reversing transactions is if you elect to sell, purchase, or trade any Song Tokens using credit card payments (as described above).\n        2. **Fees**. By buying or selling a Song Token on the DeMuse Platform, you agree to pay all applicable fees and you authorize DeMuse to automatically deduct fees (including any transaction fees, or “**Gas Fees**”, as applicable) and payment processing fees, including credit card transaction fees, directly from your payment. Gas fees fund the network of computers that run decentralized blockchain networks, meaning that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via a blockchain network.\n    8. **Disputes Between Artists and Purchasers.** DeMuse is not a party to any relationship between Artists and Purchasers or in the delivery of Song Tokens and royalty payments. In the event that you have a dispute with any Artist or Purchaser, you agree to address such dispute directly with the Artist or Purchaser.

YOU RELEASE RELEASEES FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of Song Tokens will not lose money. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money.\n    2. Our Service does not store, send, or receive cryptocurrency assets. This is because cryptocurrency assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on its supporting blockchain. Any transfer of cryptocurrency assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on the Service. Transactions in Song Tokens may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some transactions in Song Tokens shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction.\n    3. There are risks associated with using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that DeMuse will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Service for transactions, however caused.\n    4. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of a certain Song Token.\n    5. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Service and the utility of Song Tokens.\n    6. The Service may rely on third-party platforms to perform transactions with respect to any cryptocurrency assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.\n    7. There are risks associated with purchasing User generated content, including but not limited to, the risk of purchasing counterfeit assets, mislabeled assets, assets that are vulnerable to metadata decay, assets on smart contracts with bugs, and assets that may become untransferable. DeMuse reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and assets affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Assets you purchase may become inaccessible on DeMuse. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view your assets on DeMuse serve as grounds for a claim against DeMuse.\n    8. We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and DeMuse has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.\n    9. The Service relies on third-party platforms and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Service will suffer.\n    10. There are risks associated with streaming royalties. Streaming royalties are dependent upon numerous factors, including but not limited to the popularity of a particular song and the song’s availability on streaming platforms. DeMusety payments are contingent upon third-parties, including service providers and distributors outside of DeMuse’s control. You accept and acknowledge that you may receive little or no streaming royalty payments in connection with a Song Token. DeMuse is not responsible for streaming royalty payments and does not represent or guarantee that you will receive any particular amount of streaming royalties.\n    11. DeMuse reserves the right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may become inaccessible on the Services. Under no circumstances shall the inability to view items on the DeMuse Platform and/or inability to use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds for a claim against DeMuse.\n18. **Indemnity.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless DeMuse, and our respective past, present and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns (individually and collectively, the “**DeMuse Parties**”), from and against all actual or alleged third party claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract or otherwise (collectively, “**Claims**”), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to: (i) your use or misuse of the Service or DeMuse Content or User Content; (ii) your User Content or Feedback; (iii) your violation of these Terms or Artist Terms, as applicable and/or a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in the Artist Terms and/or the Song Token Details Form, as applicable; (iv) your use or disposal of any Song Tokens; (v) your violation of the rights of a third party or of applicable law, including without limitation, any use by DeMuse of User Content created and/or owned by you that violates or otherwise infringers upon the rights of a third party; or (vi) your negligence or willful misconduct. You agree to promptly notify DeMuse of any Claims and cooperate with the DeMuse Parties in defending such Claims. You further agree that the DeMuse Parties shall have control of the defense or settlement of any third-party Claims, unless otherwise mutually agreed to, which may be at your cost and expense. DeMuse will have the right to demand and be paid its actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses on an ongoing basis without prejudice to any other remedies available to DeMuse. In any event, you will not settle any Claim without DeMuse ’s prior written consent and you acknowledge and agree that any settlement or attempted settlement of the third-party Claims as described herein without DeMuse’s prior written consent shall be void. THIS INDEMNITY IS IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF, ANY OTHER INDEMNITIES SET FORTH IN ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ROYAL.\n19. **Limitation of Liability.**\n    1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL  ROYAL OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ROYAL OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n    2. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO EVENT WILL ROYAL’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, CONTENT, SONG TOKENS, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID OR ARE PAYABLE BY YOU TO ROYAL FOR USE OF THE SERVICES.\n    3. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN ROYAL AND YOU.\n        \n        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims\n        \n20. **Governing Law and Forum Choice.** These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 19 “**Dispute Resolution**,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you DeMuse are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in Delaware, and you and DeMuse each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\n21. **Dispute Resolution.**\n    1. **Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes**. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be resolved **solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding**. You and DeMuse agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and DeMuse are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.\n    2. **Exceptions**. As limited exceptions to Section 19(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.\n    3. **Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules**. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “**JAMS Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The JAMS Rules are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules. JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration at https://www.jamsadr.com/. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location, but will be conducted remotely to the extent permitted by the JAMS Rules. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.\n    4. **Arbitration Costs**. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).\n    5. **Injunctive and Declaratory Relief**. Except as provided in Section 19(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.\n    6. **Class Action Waiver**. **YOU AND ROYAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.** Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.\n    7. **Severability**. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 19(f) of these Terms (“**Class Action Waiver**”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.\n22. **General Terms.**\n    1. **Reservation of Rights**. DeMuse and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.\n    2. **Entire Agreement**. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between DeMuse and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between DeMuse and you regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without DeMuse’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. DeMuse may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.\n    3. **Notices**. Any notices or other communications provided by DeMuse under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.\n    4. **Waiver of Rights**. DeMuse’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of DeMuse. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\n23. **Contact Information.** If you have any questions about these Terms or the Services, please contact DeMuse at [notices@royal.io](mailto:notices@royal.io).\n\nDeMuse Markets Inc.  \nP.O.
